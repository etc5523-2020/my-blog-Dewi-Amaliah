Hello! This is Dewi Amaliah, your data analyst-in-residence.

I am a data nerd currently studying as a graduate student of Master of Business Analytics, Department of Econometric and Business Statistics at Monash University. Prior to being a student, I was working in Statistics Indonesia.

I created this blog as a space for learning and sharing knowledge and information related to data analytics. It is a place where I and my fellow data nerds can discuss the interesting phenomenon around us through data.

I would love to talk with my fellow data nerds. Let me know how we can catch up by dropping me an email [here](dlamaleeah@gmail.com).

Until then, enjoy the blog!
