*The sky is only the limit*. It might sound hyperbolic, but this is what I would say when talking about R and all of its packages. In other words, I would say that you basically can make anything straight from R, from a report, a gif image, a presentation slides, a letter,  even a website, not to mention the statistical analysis, from the basic to the sophisticated one. 




In this article, I would like to discuss an interactive web app that I made with one of its packages, [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). The discussion would be about the app itself and a self-review about the app. I developed this app as part of ETC5523 Communicating with Data assignment, one of the core units in the [Master of Business Analytics program](https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/find-a-course/2021/business-analytics-b6022?gclid=CjwKCAjww5r8BRB6EiwArcckC1oGdcqoRx9Uc8Pe3wqknW1rRa7GJ6VnTdCAddOlXoslHPw9ojQhrxoCIjAQAvD_BwE&international=true), Monash University. 


```{r prev-image, fig.cap="The landing page of the app", preview = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("shiny_gif/prev_image.png")
```







```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("shiny_gif/tab_1.gif")
```
